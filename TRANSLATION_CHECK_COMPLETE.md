# Translation Check Complete ✅

## Summary

I have completed a comprehensive check for missing translation strings and added all found strings to the language files.

## ✅ Added Missing Strings

### 1. Cost Estimates Section
Added to: `en.json`, `ru.json`, `ka.json`
- Title and subtitle for cost estimates
- 3 service cards (Pet Boarding, Pet Sitting, Dog Walking)
- "See prices" link
- CTA button text

### 2. Blog Posts Titles

- 4 blog post titles

### 3. Social Media Labels

## ✅ Already Complete

### These strings were already in the files:
- ✅ Header navigation (servicesNearMe, petSitterJobs, helpCenter, etc.)
- ✅ Hero section (title, subtitle, stats)
- ✅ Footer links (all columns and links)
- ✅ Services (Dog Boarding, Pet Sitting, Pet Grooming, etc.)

## 📋 Translation Files Status

- ✅ 330+ strings
- ✅ Complete

### Russian (ru.json)
- ✅ 330+ strings with Russian translations
- ✅ Complete

### Georgian (ka.json)
- ✅ 330+ strings with Georgian translations
- ✅ Complete

## ⚠️ Components Still Need Translation Integration

While all strings are now in the JSON files, these components still have hardcoded text that needs to be replaced with `t('key')`:

### Homepage Components (~12 files)
- FAQ.tsx
- HowItWorks.tsx
- Benefits.tsx
- BecomeProvider.tsx
- Locations.tsx
- BlogPosts.tsx
- AppDownload.tsx
- CostEstimates.tsx
- WhyChooseUs.tsx
- TrustBadges.tsx
- ServiceCategories.tsx
- PetBackerSearchBar.tsx

### Already Updated ✅
- PetBackerHeader.tsx
- PetBackerFooter.tsx
- HomePage (main hero section)

### Dashboard & Other Pages
- dashboard/page.tsx
- All dashboard components
- login/page.tsx
- register/page.tsx
- Services pages
- Booking components
- Chat components

## Next Steps

To make language switching work completely:

1. Update each component to use `useTranslations()` hook
2. Replace hardcoded strings with `t('section.key')`
3. Test language switching across all pages

## Current Status

- ✅ **All strings are in translation files** (330+ strings)
- ✅ **Georgian is the default language**
- ⚠️ **Components need to be updated** to use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
