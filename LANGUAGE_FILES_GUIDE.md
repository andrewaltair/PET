# Language Files Setup Guide

## Overview
I've created comprehensive language files for your PetService website with all text strings extracted from your codebase. Each file contains every word/phrase used throughout the website with context descriptions.

## Files Created

### 1. `client/src/messages/lang-strings-en.txt`
- **Language**: English
- **Status**: Complete with all strings
- **Purpose**: Reference file, also serves as English translation

### 2. `client/src/messages/lang-strings-ru.txt`
- **Language**: Russian
- **Status**: Contains English text (needs Russian translation)
- **Purpose**: You will translate Russian strings manually

### 3. `client/src/messages/lang-strings-ka.txt`
- **Language**: Georgian (ქართული)
- **Status**: Contains English text (needs Georgian translation)
- **Purpose**: You will translate Georgian strings manually

## File Format

Each string follows this format:
```
key_name - 'translation' (Context: where this text is used)
```

Example:
```
hero_title_line1 - 'Find Trusted Pet Care,' (Used in: Main hero title first line)
hero_title_line2 - 'Instantly' (Used in: Main hero title second line with gradient)
```

## Sections Covered

The language files include strings from:

1. **Header & Navigation** - Main menu, buttons, links
2. **Homepage Hero Section** - Main titles, stats, search
3. **Service Categories** - All 6 service types
4. **How It Works** - 4-step process
5. **Why Choose Us** - Benefits and features
6. **Benefits Section** - Trust indicators
7. **Become Provider** - Provider signup
8. **Locations** - Country names and location text
9. **Blog Posts** - Blog section strings
10. **App Download** - Mobile app promotion
11. **FAQ** - All 6 questions and answers
12. **Trust Badges** - Trust indicators
13. **Footer** - All footer links and text
14. **Search Bar** - Search functionality
15. **Dashboard** - Complete dashboard interface
16. **Authentication** - Login and registration pages
17. **Chat/Messages** - Messaging system

22. **Status Labels** - Booking statuses
23. **Social Media** - Social links
24. **Accessibility** - A11y labels
25. **Error Messages** - Error handling

## Total Strings

- **~200+ unique text strings** covering the entire website
- Each string has a descriptive key name
- Context information for every string
- Organized by sections for easy navigation

## Next Steps

### For You (Translation)

1. **Translate Russian** (`lang-strings-ru.txt`):
   - Replace English text with Russian translations
   - Keep the key names unchanged
   - Maintain context descriptions in English

2. **Translate Georgian** (`lang-strings-ka.txt`):
   - Replace English text with Georgian translations
   - Keep the key names unchanged
   - Maintain context descriptions in English

### For Implementation

These text files serve as documentation. To make the language switcher work:

1. Convert these strings to JSON format
2. Update `client/src/messages/en.json`, `ru.json`, `ka.json`
3. Ensure components use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
4. Test language switching functionality

## Usage Example

Current hardcoded text:
```tsx
<h1>Find Trusted Pet Care</h1>
```

Should become:
```tsx
<h1>{t('hero_title_line1')}</h1>
```

Where `t` is the translation function from `next-intl`.

## Notes

- All strings currently contain English text in all three files
- You mentioned you'll translate Georgian and Russian yourself
- Context descriptions help understand where each string appears
- Some strings may contain placeholders (numbers, dates) that should remain unchanged
- The language switcher (`LanguageSwitcher.tsx`) is already implemented and should work once the JSON files are updated

## Current Language Switcher Status

The language switcher exists but may not be working because:
1. Some components have hardcoded English text
2. The JSON message files need to be updated with all these strings
3. Components need to use the `useTranslations()` hook

Once you translate the strings and update the JSON files, the language switcher should work properly!

## Quick Reference

- English file: `lang-strings-en.txt` ✅ Complete
- Russian file: `lang-strings-ru.txt` ⏳ Needs translation
- Georgian file: `lang-strings-ka.txt` ⏳ Needs translation

Translate the strings in the Russian and Georgian files, then convert to JSON format and update your message files!
